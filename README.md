Lung Cancer Analysis and Prediction System


Introduction:

This repository contains the Lung Cancer Analysis and Prediction System, designed to identify critical factors contributing to lung cancer and predict lung cancer presence based on various health indicators. Utilizing data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into the relationship between different factors and lung cancer, and to accurately predict lung cancer occurrence.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes features such as Lung Cancer diagnosis, Gender, Age, Smoking status, Yellow fingers, Anxiety, Peer pressure, Chronic Disease, and more, providing a comprehensive set of variables for analysis.

Key Findings:

Important factors contributing to lung cancer include yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, smoking, shortness of breath, fatigue, wheezing, and chest pain.
The system demonstrates high accuracy in predicting lung cancer presence, with a model accuracy of 95% and precision and recall rates of 94% and 98%, respectively.
